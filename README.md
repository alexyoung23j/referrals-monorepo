# Referlink.xyz

Referlink was a product I built to make job referals as easy as sending a Calendly link. We launched on Product Hunt (https://www.producthunt.com/products/referlink#referlink) and made the top 10! A few hundred people signed up before it was clear this wasn't solving enough of a problem and I shut down the project.
